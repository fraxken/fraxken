### Welcome to my github page ðŸ˜Ž

My first name is Thomas, I am 25 years old and I have been developing since I was 10 years old. I'm literally a code lover and I've been passionate about creating projects with many of my friends since I was very young.

I have been actively developing for six years on Node.js. I have a great interest for everything related to the world of monitoring and gaming... I'm also more and more interested in security.

Some recent notable projects:
- https://github.com/SlimIO (More than a hundred Node.js projects: Packages, API, CLI, N-API Addons etc..)
- https://github.com/UIM-Community
- https://github.com/ES-Community/nsecure
- https://github.com/fraxken/js-x-ray

> ðŸ‘€ Feel free to consult my various projects and organizations to which I am attached.
