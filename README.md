### Welcome to my github page 😎

My first name is Thomas, and I am 25 years old and I have been developing since **I was 10 years old**. I'm literally a [code lover](https://github.com/fraxken/VM-Resources) ❤️ and I've been passionate about creating projects with many of my friends since I was very young.

I have been actively developing for six years on Node.js and over ten years for JavaScript. I have a great interest for everything related to the world of monitoring and gaming... I'm also more and more interested in security (anything that touches static analysis and reverse engineering).

✨ Some recent notable projects ✨
- https://github.com/SlimIO (More than a hundred Node.js projects: Packages, API, CLI, N-API Addons etc.. 🚀)
- https://github.com/UIM-Community
- https://github.com/ES-Community/nsecure
