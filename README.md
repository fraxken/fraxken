### Welcome to my github page üòé

My first name is Thomas, and I am 28 years old and I have been developing since **I was 10 years old**. I'm literally a [code lover](https://github.com/fraxken/VM-Resources) ‚ù§Ô∏è and I've been passionate about creating projects with many of my friends since I was very young (Yoursblog, Antarka, Ethernuum, SlimIO etc..).

I have been actively developing for eight years on Node.js and over ten years for JavaScript. I have a great interest for everything related to the world of monitoring and gaming... I'm also more and more interested in security (anything that touches static analysis and reverse engineering). I take more and more pleasure in studying the semantics of programming languages too!

‚ú® Some notable projects ‚ú®
- https://github.com/SlimIO (More than a hundred Node.js projects: Packages, API, CLI, N-API Addons etc.. üöÄ)
- https://github.com/UIM-Community (Some of my work around CA UIM.. note that I was elected community champion for my contributions).
- https://github.com/ES-Community/nsecure
- https://github.com/NodeSecure
- https://github.com/AntarkaGame

I occasionally write articles about my various projects (mainly SlimIO and Node-secure)..
